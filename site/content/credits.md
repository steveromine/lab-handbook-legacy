## With thanks

This lab ran for a short while as an experiment, and it did not run alone. It owes a real debt to
**everyone who gave feedback, made a suggestion, offered a correction, or asked the right question at
the right moment** - and to the open-source maintainers whose work it is built on. Thank you.

Names are deliberately not listed here. This page was written for a moment in time; the people who
helped are not a footnote to it, and a list frozen at one date would misrepresent a longer story. The
thanks are genuine and they are general, on purpose.

Humans are credited first on this page on purpose. The lab exists to learn how to build an AI platform that **integrates people into the process rather than replacing them** - the argument for that is on [About](/about/).

## How this page is meant to be read

The [licence page](/license/) states what *you* may do with this site. **This** page is the other half:
an inventory of everything the lab itself stands on, with the licence each piece carries. Where a term
is restrictive or non-commercial, it says so plainly rather than in a footnote.

Legends: **open** - OSI-approved or equivalent free licence · **source-available / controlled** - usable
but not free · **non-commercial** - restricts commercial use · **service** - a hosted product, not code.

## OSINT and research

Five upstream research tools, each run as its **own non-root container**, joined to the lab's internal
network with no published host port, and pinned by image digest:

| Piece | Role | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| **shodan-python** | Host and exposure lookups against the Shodan API | per upstream (**not declared** to the licence registry) |
| **theHarvester** | Domain, host and email reconnaissance | **GPL-2.0** (**open**) |
| **SpiderFoot** | Attack-surface scanning (loopback UI only) | **MIT** (**open**) |
| **Maigret** | Username and profile discovery | **MIT** (**open**) |
| **Blackbird** | Account search across public sources | **none declared upstream** - see the caveat below |
| **Open WebUI** | Chat front-end that hosts the Lab OSINT model | **its own licence** (**source-available / controlled**) |

### The honest part

The **licences here genuinely differ, and one of them is missing.** Blackbird ships **no licence file at
all**, which means the default "all rights reserved" applies until its author says otherwise - so it is
used only as an unmodified, internal, non-redistributed tool, and that limitation is written down rather
than assumed away. Shodan's Python client likewise flags no licence to the registry. Neither fact is
buried in a footnote: if a credit is wrong or missing, that is a bug worth
[reporting](/requests/). The pinned source revisions live in the lab's own `sources.json`.

Running alongside them is an **admin-owned `lab-osint` model** served on the lab's own GPU - so the
research tools and the language model that summarises their output both stay inside the lab.

## Non-commercial caveat, restated

Everything on this site is legitimately ours to publish, **but the generated pictures and songs inherit
a non-commercial limitation** from the musicgen and sd-turbo weights that produced them. Prose and code
are ours to license freely; the generated media is not, for commercial purposes. The
[licence page](/license/) carries the same caveat.

## Corrections welcome

If a licence above is wrong or a dependency is missing, that is a bug worth
[reporting](/requests/) - an incorrect credit is worse than none.
